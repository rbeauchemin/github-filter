## Github Filters Extension
I made a little extension to filter pull requests in a world where we will have mono-repos so it's a little easier to get to reviews more interesting to you.
## Add it in Chrome
1. First go into "Manage Extensions"
2. Click Developer Mode at the top right
3. Add the GHFilter folder (after reviewing I am not Cross-script hacking all of your info of course)
4. Next go to a PR board and select what you want from the filters, copying the "?q=..." from the URL.
5. Change the settings using the options on the loaded extension, or right-clicking on the icon (after pinning if you like)

Now when you click the cat, it will reload the page with your saved query parameters. This will persist across browsers and sessions until you change the options again. Enjoy!
